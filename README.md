# Adria Pons Unity 3D Environment
Hello! My name is Adrià Pons and I am a Bachelor's Student in Video Game Design and Development at CITM in Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona.

The current repository was created to host my 3D Stylized Modular Environment for the second year subject 3D Environments. 

The software used in the project was:

- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) for the moodboard references of the project.
- [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.es/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) and [ZBrush](https://www.maxon.net/en/zbrush) for 3D modeling and digital sculpting.
- [Adobe Substance 3D Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html) for textures painting.
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) for the whole scene and environment composition.
